                Introduction
            </header>
            <p>Hi my name is Solomzi I am studying for my CCNA certification and aspiring to be a network engineer. <br>
             In this website I'll be writing down the notes of what I learnt in my own words and as simple as i can for anyone who may read.<br>
             On my first I covered quite a number of things including switches, routers, wireless access points which will all be explained in theor respective sections.<br>
             Let's get to it!

                Switches
            </header>
            <p>
                Switches are successors to a network device called a hub, so in simple terms a switch is a better version of a hub. One may ask what makes a switch different from a hub?
                Here is a list of things the switch does that differentiates it from a hub:
                <ul>
                    <li>Switches work on the second layer of the OSI model whilst hubs work on the first</li>
                    <li>Switches have collision domains on each port whilst hubs had one collision domain</li>
                    <li>Switches have more ports compared to hubs</li>
                    <li>Switches filter packets whilst hubs don't</li>
                    <li>Switches use full duplex transmission mode whilst hubs use half duplex </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <header>What do switches do?</header>
                A switch receives frames and directs them to their destination.<br>
                A switch learns a mac address when a device sends it a frame then it stores that mac address in something known as the CAM table. <br>
                If the mac address is not found on the CAM table the switch floods the first frame to all ports.<br>
                Switches are a plug and play.
