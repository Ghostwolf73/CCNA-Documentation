            <p>Hi my name is Solomzi I am studying for my CCNA certification and aspiring to be a network engineer. <br>
             In this website I'll be writing down the notes of what I learnt in my own words and as simple as i can for anyone who may read.<br>
             On my first I covered quite a number of things including switches, routers, wireless access points which will all be explained in theor respective sections.<br>
             Let's get to it!
